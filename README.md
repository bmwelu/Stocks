# StockScreener
My goal is to learn Angular 5, Node, and express.  This project is creating some common widgets that are useful for monitoring and researching stocks.

## Technologies
The Web App was created using Node, Express, Angular5

## Considerations
Running the solution locally requires port 4200 for the client and port 8000 for the server open.

## TODO
Unit tests for front and backend

Accounts to save stocks, etc.

Attach live news to each stocks

Modules for currencies and sectors

After hours moves

Green/Red arrows indicating last update positive/negative

Considerations for security, DOS attacks, etc.

Cache recommended stock list?

Once the details view is open, continue to update? For current price

In client code create global constaints for intraday,daily,weekly,monthly values (0,1,2,3)

Only have timed api calls during trading hours
